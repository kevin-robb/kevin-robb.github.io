The theme was Retro, and we love Dungeons & Dragons, so we decided to make a phone app that can import character sheets and automatically perform rolls with one click, or prompt the user with which dice they should roll; it then uses OpenCV to detect the dice values, calculate the result, and share that and the video feed with the other players in the lobby.</h4>
