                                <h3>
                                    Born and raised in Fort Worth, TX, I earned degrees in Engineering Physics and Mathematics at the University of Oklahoma, and am currently working on my master's in Robotics at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. <br><br>
                                    My primary areas of interest in robotics are state estimation and navigation, and I have experience using ROS and Kalman filtering to perform mobile robot localization. I'm also skilled in machine learning, and have specialized in evolutionary computation for my largest research projects. I'd like to expand my focus area from pure software to more embedded applications, and as such am working to grow my electrical and mechanical skillset alongside my software and theory proficiencies. <br><br>
                                    My non-technical hobbies include playing soccer, tennis, and dungeons & dragons. I'm an artist and enjoy penwork and digital painting. Lastly, I'm passionate about helping people learn! I loved working as a campus tour guide during my time at OU, and have spent most of my life involved with STEM education projects.<br><br>
                                    If you'd like to contact me, I can be best reached by email.
